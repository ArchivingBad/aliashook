//This a config that executes then tf2 starts up.
//It links most of the other cfgs together by 
//executing them allowing them to alias many 
//things to allow amazing gameplay experience. 
//
//If you have come across this from Julianacat, then I hope you enjoy these cfgs.
//In every one of the many cfgs are the description of what it does.
//Many things are not commented well but I try my best!
//Also for those of you that would like to make use of these scripts, you
//may need some scripting knowlage to adapt it for your uses.
//
//For any of those that are concerned about loops, I have put wait checkers in
//EVERY loop within my scripts that can work on its own to prevent feedback crashes.
//Even if a loop is running and you switch to a different server with wait 
//disabled, as soon as it prosses once, the loop shal close and move to a function
//acording to what the loop is being used to do to allow itself to work, but with limited function.
//
//If you have questions, please contact Julianacat at this steam url.
//http://steamcommunity.com/id/Julianacat/
//
//For best viewing experience in browsing these cfgs, use notepad++
//and use this custon language script.
